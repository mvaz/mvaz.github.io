Yay!
Soon I'll be replacing my NSLU2 with it, but some clouds are shadowing the horizon.
I didn't have the time to set it up.
Debian 5.03 (lenny) is pre-installed, but only on the device's flash, whose 512MB will probably not suffice to all I want it to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sad thing is, I don't have the time to make all the decisions I need, like "do I need to update U-BOOT?" or "Better to install from scratch or take the
already working Debian installation on my Slug?", like &lt;a href="http://www.cyrius.com/debian/nslu2/sheevaplug-migration.html"&gt;Martin Michlmayr&lt;/a&gt; suggests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, many users are reporting heat issues, with their GuruPlug Plus even stopping to work with gigabit ethernet plugged in (the photos are very impressive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New IT is &lt;a href="http://www.newit.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,419.0.html"&gt;suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that people stick to 100MB ethernet (wish would mean that I'm on the clear side with
my non-Gb GuruPlug Standard), but it is &lt;a href="http://www.newit.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,423.0.html"&gt;not a safe solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems in the components and the montage seem to be the cause as the pictures &lt;a href="http://guruplug.daloo.de"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; document.
Anyway, my first test will simply be to turn it on for a couple of days.
If it's safe, I'll proceed... otherwise have to choose between sending it back to NewIT, selling it, or hacking it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
