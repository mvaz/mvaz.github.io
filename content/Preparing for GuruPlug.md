According to news from the guys at [NewIT](http://www.newit.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,323.msg1595.html), I'll probably be receiving my [GuruPlug Server](http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/t-guruplugdetails.aspx) in the next days! Yeah!!
I've been using a NSLU2 with Debian over the last years for video streaming, file sharing and torrent downloading (only legal ones, of course).

The GuruPlug has a bit more horsepower to offer, which not only means that there will be much less stuttering with videos, but also that more functionalities could be added.
A lot of possibilities come to mind, from coupling to home automation or monitoring applications, a webcam, or, 
most appealing to me, to adding video output and connect it the TV, where browsing the web would be possible.

Someone has already done this, using an usb2vga adaptor and recompiling the kernel with support for the necessary modules, but has offered little specs of the process.

Also because of this, other people have failed in getting that to work, which is a most definite turn-off.

But first things first.
Need to see how good the Debian installation that's supposed to come wuth the device is, and maybe move to an USB stick.
