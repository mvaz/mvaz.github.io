Title: First post or blogging from TextMate

I used to have a Wordpress blog, bug soon got tired of all its features.
It's too bloated for my taste, and wouldn't blend in with a normal website, which is what I'd like to embed this blog into,
as [Adrifolio](http://adrifolio.tumblr.com/post/487702548/how-to-embed-tumblr-on-your-website-and-customize-it) explains.
So this is why I'm using **tumblr** now.

I'm still setting up the environment, syntax highlighting still broken in [TextMate](http://macromates.com), and not getting the same nice preview results as [timgurley](http://blog.timgourley.com/post/469491122/tumblr-from-textmate).
Maybe if I write the posts in *HTML*, but was thinking of using *Markdown* for the moment.
Anyway, kudos to [mwunsch](http://mwunsch.tumblr.com/post/441371943/tumblr-rb), because the ruby [gem](http://github.com/mwunsch/tumblr) is pretty cool and easy to use.
